# Caveman Survival
Caveman Survival is a 2D platform scrolling game for Windows.

Created by Matthew Ward, Jessica Ward, Killian Comerford, Joshua Lowe and Nathan Murray, it was originally planned and developed for Junior Achievement Isle of Man, in which we had the chance to start a business and develop a product.

A Christmas edition of the game was developed for a charity stall at a school Christmas fayre.

We used the C# programming language, and XNA as a game framework to develop the game. This decision was made as we had previous experience with this language and framework from previous projects.

The Caveman Survival project helped further our knowledge in developing software, and helped build on our team-working and presentation skills.
