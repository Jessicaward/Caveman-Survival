  Caveman Survival is a 2D platform scrolling game for Windows. It was created by Matthew Ward, Jessica Ward, Killian Comerford, Joshua Lowe and Nathan Murray.

  It was originally planned and developed for Junior Achievement Isle of Man, in which we had the chance to create our own company and develop a product. We then developed a Christmas edition of the game for a charity stall at a Christmas fayre.

  We used XNA with C# to develop the game as we had previous experience with this language and framework from other projects. 
  
  The Caveman Survival project helped further our knowledge in developing software, and helped build on our team-working and presentation skills.
